# gpt2-architecture-from-scratch
From-scratch implementation of the GPT-2 architecture for learning and experimentation.

## Acknowledgement

This project is inspired by Sebastian Raschka’s educational repositories and teaching style, especially his emphasis on building models from first principles.

The code in this repository is written independently and serves as a personal learning exercise to understand the GPT-2 architecture in depth.

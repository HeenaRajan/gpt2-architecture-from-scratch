# gpt2-architecture-from-scratch
From-scratch implementation of the GPT-2 architecture for learning and experimentation.

## Acknowledgement

This project is inspired by Sebastian Raschka’s educational repositories and particularly his clear, from-scratch approach to explaining large language models.

The code in this repository is written independently and serves as a personal learning exercise to understand the GPT-2 architecture in depth.
